# "dependencies" tag allows user to include other packages into their project. There is a package manager built into
# wio and you can make use of that by specifying packages in this tag. Dependencies will be a list of packages and
# you can specify different options for each of them. Following are some key points about this"
# - url is where you specify the url of the package. So Far only "Git" supported urls are accepted.
# - ref is where you can specify a branch to checkout the library from
# - compile_flags are where you specify the compile flags for the dependency
# Example:
# dependencies:
#   myLib:
#       url: "URL1"
#       ref: "REF1"
#       compile_flags: ["HELLO", "NOO"]
#   myLib2:
#       url: "URL2"
