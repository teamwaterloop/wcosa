# "pkg" tag contains core information about the project. This will produce a package that can be used in other
# wio projects. Wio provides native support for packages created this way and they are included flawlessly.
# Following are some key points about customizing your package:
# - Frameworks are SDKs for embedded devices. They contain set of libraries to use when coding.
#   Wio supports core "arduino" and "cosa" (an open source OOP AVR development platform).
# - Platform is the type of chip that this application will be uploaded. This platform provides
#   libraries to access chip hardware and compilers to compile them. Wio supports "AVR" platform.
# - You can specify multiple authors, frameworks and boards. This information will be used to check if this
#   library is compatible with the project it is being used in.
# - If you want your package to be compiled with certain flags when used, provide those flags in compile_flags tag.
